Tic Tac Toe Game Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:-

Tic Tac Toe is a simple two-player game that is commonly built as a beginner's project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Hereâ€™s a deep dive into how to create a basic Tic Tac Toe game and how each language contributes to the project.

Languages Used:-
HTML (HyperText Markup Language): Used to create the structure of the game. It defines the layout and elements such as buttons, text, and containers.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Used to style the elements created in HTML. This includes colors, fonts, sizes, positioning, and overall design aesthetics.

JavaScript: Used to implement the game logic. This includes handling player moves, checking for win conditions, drawing conditions, and switching turns.

How to Run the Code:-
1.Create Project Files:

Create a new folder for your project.
Inside the folder, create three files: index.html, styles.css, and script.js.
Copy and paste the corresponding code into these files.

2.Run the Game:

Open the index.html file in any web browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, etc.) by double-clicking on it or right-clicking and choosing "Open with...".

3.Play the Game:

You will see a 3x3 grid for the Tic Tac Toe game.
Players can click on any cell to make their move. The game will check for a win or draw condition after each move.

4.Explanation of the Code:

HTML creates the game structure, such as the grid cells (div elements with data-cell attributes) and a restart button.

CSS styles the game board and cells, including colors, grid layout, and hover effects.

JavaScript handles the game logic:

startGame Function: Initializes the game and sets up event listeners for each cell.
handleClick Function: Handles what happens when a cell is clicked (mark placement, checking win or draw).
placeMark Function: Adds the player's mark (X or O) to the clicked cell.
swapTurns Function: Alternates the turns between players.
checkWin Function: Checks if the current player has won the game.
isDraw Function: Checks if the game has ended in a draw.

Conclusion:-

By following the above steps, you can create a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This game demonstrates the integration of front-end development skills, including layout structuring (HTML), styling (CSS), and logic implementation (JavaScript).
